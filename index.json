Because we think that scientific methods prove the theories. Because medicines cure peoeple, cars drive, planes fly, etc. Watch this!\nBut now let\u0026rsquo;s see things from a different perspective. Scientists make a drug to cure a disease, which works. But after some time they realize it\u0026rsquo;s side effects. Oh, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. Not good. They invent plastic. They think, wow such a wonderful invention, good for the humankind. But soon they realize that they have completely f**ked up the humankind and now they are on the verge of extinction. So they make something, realize their mistake, improve it and so on. So that they can give better justifications. So their predictions supposedly keep getting better. Refining theories with time.\nThey say, hydrogen and oxygen together make water. So we go and mix hydrogen and oxygen. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make water. Then they say, oh, you need a certain pressure and temperature, only then it will work. Still it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. Then they say, oh, you also need such and such catalyst. Okay, so you see what\u0026rsquo;s happening. So science is just trial and error. Nothing more. You might say, so is the religion. I agree.\nBut religion has been followed for thousands of years (or even millions). While science is just a few centuries old. So religious theories have been continuously refined over time. So I believe that religion has become so perfect till now that it is actually capable of making better predictions and giving better justifications.\nSee, people have been following religion for so much time because it worked for them. When they did some witchcraft, it worked. When they did a \u0026ldquo;havan\u0026rdquo;, it worked (mostly). Notion of GOD worked! Notion of Hell and Heaven worked. People were afraid to do the wrong things because of such notions. So it worked.\nThe only problem with religion, according to me, is that its justifications are not easily observable by our five senses. Like, if GOD is there, why he is not visible.\nThere are still many things which science hasn\u0026rsquo;t explained yet. But religion does — for example, rebirth, life after death, consciousness etc. So there is no way that science is better than religion.\nIf you have a different view on this, kindly drop me an email. I would be happy to see it through your perspective.\n","date":1568419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568419200,"objectID":"99a4e15c60de566882b6f3e68e0bf481","permalink":"/post/science_vs_religion/","publishdate":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/science_vs_religion/","section":"post","summary":"Is science any better than religion?","tags":["Thoughts",""],"title":"Science vs Religion","type":"post"},{"authors":["Amit Yadav"],"categories":null,"content":" While watching the above video, I had a few thoughts which I thought would be good to post here. These are not very well arranged and are my own personal.\nIn a Jack Ma and Elon Musk conversation at Shanghai, Jack Ma says that he wishes for a future where people have to work only for 3 days a week, 4 hours per day. Electricity will give them more time by doing their part of the job. So that they have more time being human beings. So that they can go to dances, beaches, visit more cities and so on.\nMy thoughts:\nSo as of now, when people are dis-connected from each other because of technology (think about lonileness), what do they do in their free time?\nNetflix? Facebook? Insta?\nSo what are people gonna do when they get more free time? More netflix? More facebook? Point is, when in past, people had to work to get their bread, they were happy. Their physical health was good, mental health was good (assumed). There was no need of gym. No need of counselor. This free time, where there is no worry of getting food, facilities, electricity, seems like the root cause of depression, or unhappiness. Won\u0026rsquo;t people start to have existential crisis?\nI feel that \u0026quot;Be busy. Be happy\u0026quot; works.\nWhat if such situations arise: Oh I am bored of life, there is nothing to do.Few more thoughts:\nSo people have seed-banks (for example Svalbard global seed vault). Because they are afraid of human disaster. That someday, all crops might get extinct. They are afraid that something might happen to earth oneday. They are already suspicious. People (like Musk) are trying to be multi-planetry. Means they are not sure of earth\u0026rsquo;s future. Earth which has been there for millions of years, now it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be safe anymore. Wow.\nAh I can\u0026rsquo;t sleep with peace now. Just one question in mind:\nIf mars can be made like earth, why earth can\u0026rsquo;t be?\nFew more points from the conversation:\n Elon Musk  26:45 Human are extremely slow compared to AI. Same goes for current education system. In future you can just upload a book directly. Best way to predict future is to make it.  Jack Ma  Men can never make men (not even mosquito). Computers can calculate/memorize better than humans. Humans need to be creative (dancing, painting) etc.     **Key features:** - **Page builder** - Create *anything* with [**widgets**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/) and [**elements**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) - **Edit any type of content** - Blog posts, publications, talks, slides, projects, and more! - **Create content** in [**Markdown**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/), [**Jupyter**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/jupyter/), or [**RStudio**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-rstudio) - **Plugin System** - Fully customizable [**color** and **font themes**](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/themes/) - **Display Code and Math** - Code highlighting and [LaTeX math](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) supported - **Integrations** - [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), [Disqus commenting](https://disqus.com), Maps, Contact Forms, and more! - **Beautiful Site** - Simple and refreshing one page design - **Industry-Leading SEO** - Help get your website found on search engines and social media - **Media Galleries** - Display your images and videos with captions in a customizable gallery - **Mobile Friendly** - Look amazing on every screen with a mobile friendly version of your site - **Multi-language** - 15+ language packs including English, 中文, and Português - **Multi-user** - Each author gets their own profile page - **Privacy Pack** - Assists with GDPR - **Stand Out** - Bring your site to life with animation, parallax backgrounds, and scroll effects - **One-Click Deployment** - No servers.
