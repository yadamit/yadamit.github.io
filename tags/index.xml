      <title>Linux Command-line tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you have seven courses in a semester, it gets a little hard to keep track of all assignment/project submission deadlines. Since I spend most of my time working on a linux terminal,  I felt it would be really helpful if I could check my deadlines with a simple command. So I wrote a command line tool in python which lists all upcoming deadlines, along with number of days left.
It might not be a very efficient tool but it gets the work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yadamit/Deadlines&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a To-Do tool which is a modified version of the Deadlines tool.
Check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yadamit/TODO-tool&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ping me if you have any suggestions or feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Science vs Religion</title>
      <link>/post/science_vs_religion/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/science_vs_religion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The following thought process is inspired from a &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Science&amp;rdquo; course that I am currently undertaking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we believe in science?&lt;br /&gt;
Our belief nowadays is more inclined towards science than religion. Because we think that scientific methods prove the theories. Because medicines cure peoeple, cars drive, planes fly, etc. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OtFSDKrq88&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Watch this!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now let&amp;rsquo;s see things from a different perspective.
&lt;!-- But here I argue that science is no better than religion. --&gt;
&lt;!-- How? --&gt;
Scientists make a drug to cure a disease, which works. But after some time they realize it&amp;rsquo;s side effects. Oh, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Not good.
They invent plastic. They think, wow such a wonderful invention, good for the humankind. But soon they realize that they have completely f**ked up the humankind and now they are on the verge of extinction.
So they make something, realize their mistake, improve it and so on. So that they can give better justifications. So their predictions supposedly keep getting better. Refining theories with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say, hydrogen and oxygen together make water. So we go and mix hydrogen and oxygen. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make water. Then they say, oh, you need a certain pressure and temperature, only then it will work. Still it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Then they say, oh, you also need such and such catalyst.
Okay, so you see what&amp;rsquo;s happening.
&lt;!-- That is also how the religion works. --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So science is just trial and error. Nothing more. You might say, so is the religion. I agree.&lt;br /&gt;
But religion has been followed for thousands of years (or even millions). While science is just a few centuries old.
So religious theories have been continuously refined over time. So I believe that religion has become so perfect till now that it is actually capable of making better predictions and giving better justifications.&lt;br /&gt;
See, people have been following religion for so much time because it worked for them. When they did some witchcraft, it worked. When they did a &amp;ldquo;havan&amp;rdquo;, it worked (mostly).
Notion of GOD worked! Notion of Hell and Heaven worked. People were afraid to do the wrong things because of such notions. So it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main issue with religion, according to me, is that its justifications are not easily observable by our five senses. Like, if GOD exists, why is he not visible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still many things which science hasn&amp;rsquo;t explained yet. But religion does — for example, rebirth, life after death, consciousness etc.
So there is no way that science is any better than religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a different view on this, kindly drop me an &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:yamit@iitk.ac.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. I would be happy to see it through your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Few thoughts about future</title>
      <link>/post/thougts_about_future/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/thougts_about_future/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3lUEnMaiAU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/uqpPUi5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;While watching the above video, I had a few thoughts which I thought would be good to post here. These are not very well arranged and are my own personal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Jack Ma and Elon Musk conversation at Shanghai, Jack Ma &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/f3lUEnMaiAU?t=1113&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that he wishes for a future where people have to work only for 3 days a week, 4 hours per day. Electricity will give them more time by doing their part of the job. So that they have more time being human beings. So that they can go to dances, beaches, visit more cities and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as of now, when people are dis-connected from each other because of technology (think about lonileness), what do they do in their free time?&lt;br /&gt;
Netflix? Facebook? Insta?&lt;br /&gt;
So what are people gonna do when they get more free time? More netflix? More facebook?
Point is, when in past, people had to work to get their bread, they were happy. Their physical health was good, mental health was good (assumed). There was no need of gym. No need of counselor.
This free time, where there is no worry of getting food, facilities, electricity, seems like the root cause of depression, or unhappiness. Won&amp;rsquo;t people start to have existential crisis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- People now have more time to think about what they are. They don&#39;t understand, so they get existential crisis.  --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;Be busy. Be happy&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; works.&lt;br /&gt;
What if such situations arise: &lt;code&gt;Oh I am bored of life, there is nothing to do&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;!--let&#39;s suicide --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Few more thoughts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So people have seed-banks (for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.croptrust.org/our-work/svalbard-global-seed-vault/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Svalbard global seed vault&lt;/a&gt;). Because they are afraid of human disaster. That someday, all crops might get extinct. They are afraid that something might happen to earth oneday. They are already suspicious.
People (like Musk) are trying to be multi-planetry. Means they are not sure of earth&amp;rsquo;s future. Earth which has been there for millions of years, now it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be safe anymore. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep with peace now. Just one question in mind:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If mars can be made like earth, why earth can&amp;rsquo;t be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few more points from the conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elon Musk

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/f3lUEnMaiAU?t=1605&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;26:45&lt;/a&gt; Human are extremely slow compared to AI. Same goes for current education system. In future you can just upload a book directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best way to predict future is to make it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Ma

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Men can never make men (not even mosquito).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers can calculate/memorize better than humans. Humans need to be creative (dancing, painting) etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
