- This repo contains the generated static code by `hugo`.
- Use the `yadamit` repo to generate this code. Just run `hugo` command in that repo.
- The academic module (with a little changes) is stored on my laptop. Always use that one only.
- Source code's repo is [`https://github.com/yadamit/yadamit/`](https://github.com/yadamit/yadamit/).
